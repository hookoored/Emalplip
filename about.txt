Emalplip v1.3.0 Alpha

Emalplip(stands for Easy Math And Logic Programming Language In Python) is a programming language that allows users to computate values with easy-to-understand commmands.

Commands:

    print string1 string2 ... - Prints the strings in order

    add addend1 addend 2 ... - Adds the addends together

    subtract minuend subtrahend1 subtrahend2 ... - Subtracts the subtrachends from the minuend

    multiply factor1 factor2 ... - Multiplies the factors together

    divide dividend divisor1 divisor2 ... - Divides the dividend by the divisors

    modulo dividend divisor - Finds dividend mod divisor

    power base exponent - Raises base to exponent
    defint name value - Defines variable with name as name that stands for value

    about - Gives information about Emalplip

    errors - Shows all errors the user has made

    commands_written - Shows all commands the player has inputed

    stats - Shows number of errors made and number of commands executed

    exit - Exits Emalplip and returns to standard Python Shell

    gullible - Makes user more easily tricked by commands that don't exist but are listed in the "about" section



What's new:

    -Added functions.py, run_code.py, greeting.txt, about.txt, and updates.txt

        >Functions.py is a custom made module used to process the subtract, multiply,
divide, and modulo functions

        >run_code.py is used to run code files

        >greetings.txt stores the greeting you see each time you start Emalplip

        >about.txt stores the text seen when about is used

        >updates.txt is a list of all updates

    -Added support for floats



What's coming:

    -print command

    -Support for code files (file extention will be .em, but the shell can run other types)
    -Support for strings

    -More error messages so no Python execptions will pop up
